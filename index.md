## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Imaging Science from <strong>Rochester Institute of Technology, New York</strong>. My anticipated graduation date is 2023.

My current research focus is on <strong>Shift Variant Image Deconvolution</strong>. I have developed a novel deep learning-based image restoration algorithm rooted in physics-informed principles which is called <strong>ShiVaNet</strong>. It has proven highly effective in nullifying shift-variant image blur, surpassing contemporary techniques with a notable improvement of 0.2 dB in PSNR. My research is relevant to microscopic images and can unblur highly blurred images given the point spread function of the microscope.

Previously,I worked as a Senior Engineer in the Computer Vision team at <strong>L&T Technology Services</strong> for 3 years. I played a pivotal role in spearheading the development of <strong>Bird Eye Object Detection</strong>. This involved leading the integration and calibration of cameras for generating a bird's eye view image and developing a highly efficient deep learning pipeline for almost real-time object detection on this unique perspective. Additionally, I made substantial contributions to diverse projects, including Activity Recognition on Jetson TX2 board, Visual Odometry, and Piping and Instrumentation diagram digitization.
